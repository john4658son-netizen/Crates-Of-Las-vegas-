ISPM-15 Heat Treatment for Secure International Shipping Crates in Las Vegas

When it comes to international shipping, compliance and protection are non-negotiable. Businesses shipping goods overseas must meet strict international regulations while ensuring their products arrive safely, intact, and on time. That’s where ISPM-15 heat treatment services from Crates of Las Vegas play a critical role in secure global logistics.

At Crates of Las Vegas, we specialize in ISPM-15 compliant heat-treated wooden crates designed to meet international export standards and protect high-value cargo during transit. From industrial machinery and medical equipment to artwork, trade show materials, and sensitive commercial products, our heat-treated shipping crates deliver peace of mind for exporters across Las Vegas and beyond.

What Is ISPM-15 Heat Treatment?

ISPM-15 (International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15) is a globally recognized regulation that governs the use of solid wood packaging materials in international trade. The standard requires wood packaging—such as crates, pallets, and dunnage—to be heat treated or fumigated to eliminate pests and insects that could spread across borders.

Heat treatment involves raising the core temperature of the wood to a minimum of 56°C (132.8°F) for at least 30 minutes, ensuring harmful organisms are destroyed. Once treated, the wood is stamped with the official ISPM-15 certification mark, which is required by customs authorities worldwide.

Without ISPM-15 compliance, shipments risk customs delays, rejection, fines, or even destruction—making proper heat treatment essential for international shipping success.

Why ISPM-15 Compliance Matters for Your Business

Non-compliant packaging can cost businesses time, money, and reputation. Customs officials in many countries strictly inspect incoming shipments, and improperly treated wood packaging can result in costly disruptions.
