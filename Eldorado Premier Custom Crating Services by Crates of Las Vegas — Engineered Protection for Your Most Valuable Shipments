From local moves to nationwide freight and international export, our custom crating services ensure your valuable cargo arrives safe — every time.

Why Custom Crating Matters in Eldorado

Generic shipping boxes and standard containers might be fine for everyday items — but they can’t protect high‑value, fragile, bulky, or irregularly shaped cargo. When your items are expensive, sentimental, or mission‑critical, you face serious risks without professional protection:

✔ Impact damage from handling or transit
✔ Vibration or shock damage over long distances
✔ Moisture, dust, and environmental exposure
✔ Internal movement and shifting during shipping
✔ Carrier mishandling due to weak packaging

Custom crating provides engineered packaging solutions that address these challenges — protecting your investment at every stage from pickup to delivery.

What Sets Our Custom Crating Services Premier

At Crates of Las Vegas, custom crating is both a craft and a science. Our team combines engineering precision, high‑quality materials, and professional construction to produce crates that outperform generic alternatives. Here’s what makes our Eldorado custom crating premier:

1. Tailored Crate Design Built Around Your Cargo

Every project begins with a detailed assessment of your item’s unique characteristics:

📏 Exact measurements and shape profiling
⚖ Weight distribution and stability planning
📦 Fragility and sensitivity analysis
🚚 Handling and transportation logistics

Using this data, we design a custom crate specifically engineered for your cargo — ensuring a perfect fit, superior protection, and minimized movement during transit.

2. Premium Materials & Quality Craftsmanship

A custom crate is only as good as the materials and construction behind it. That’s why every crate we build uses:

✔ Structural‑grade lumber and reinforced framing
✔ Professional‑grade fasteners and hardware
✔ Moisture‑resistant barriers and wraps (when needed)
✔ Interior padding and bracing systems tailored to your item

Our experienced craftsmen build each crate with precision and care, ensuring it withstands real‑world stress, handling, and environmental challenges.

3. Protection Solutions for Diverse Cargo Types

Eldorado clients trust us with a wide array of shipments — and we deliver tailored crating solutions for them all:

Industrial & Heavy Equipment

Machinery, parts, and technical gear require crates with robust structural support and secure load distribution systems.

Fine Art & Fragile Goods

Artwork, glass, antiques, and décor benefit from vibration‑absorbing interiors and cushioned support.

Medical & Scientific Equipment

Sensitive devices demand internal stabilization that prevents shocks and preserves calibration.

Electronics & AV Systems

Static‑safe internal padding and secure bracing protect delicate components and circuitry.

Trade Show Displays & Exhibits

Custom displays and modular components often require nonstandard crating designed for protection and repeated use.

No matter the type or sensitivity of your cargo, we match crate design to your item’s unique needs — giving you protection that performs.

Engineered for Handling, Transport & Storage

Custom crating should not only protect — it should function throughout every stage of your logistics process. That’s why our crates are built to:

✔ Be forklift‑ready — for secure, efficient loading and unloading
✔ Stack safely — for storage optimization
✔ Display clear orientation labels — for proper handling
✔ Reduce shock and vibration — for fragile shipments

These thoughtful features help you save time, reduce handling costs, and ensure safe, secure transport.
