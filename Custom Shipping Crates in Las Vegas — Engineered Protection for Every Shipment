Custom Shipping Crates in Las Vegas — Engineered Protection for Every Shipment

Shipping valuable, heavy, or fragile items is more than just placing them in a box—it’s about customized protection, precision engineering, and peace of mind. At Crates of Las Vegas, we specialize in Custom Shipping Crates built right here in Las Vegas to meet your unique requirements—whether you’re transporting industrial machinery, fine art, medical equipment, trade show displays, or any other high‑value cargo.

Our expertly designed custom shipping crates aren’t just packaging—they’re precision‑built solutions that protect your investment, simplify logistics, and deliver reliable performance from pickup to final destination.

Why Custom Shipping Crates Matter

Standard packaging often falls short when it comes to securing large, irregularly shaped, or sensitive items. Generic boxes and off‑the‑shelf solutions simply don’t provide the structural strength or fit precision required for reliable international or domestic shipping.

With custom shipping crates, you benefit from:

✔ Perfectly tailored dimensions for your cargo
✔ Maximum protection against shock and vibration
✔ Durable materials that endure rough handling
✔ Easy handling and stacking during transport
✔ Compliance with freight carrier requirements

Custom crates aren’t just nice to have—they’re essential for reducing damage, minimizing delays, and ensuring every shipment arrives in pristine condition.

Tailored Crate Solutions for Every Industry

At Crates of Las Vegas, we serve a wide range of industries with custom crate solutions that are engineered to perform:

Industrial & Heavy Equipment

Machinery, industrial components, engines, and specialized tools all demand strong, sturdy packaging. Our crates are designed with reinforced framing and internal supports to safeguard heavy loads during transport.

Medical & Scientific Equipment

Precision instruments, imaging devices, and laboratory machines require careful handling and secure isolation. Our custom crates fit these devices snugly and include internal bracing and protective materials to safeguard delicate parts.

Art, Antiques & Collectibles

Fine art and antiques are irreplaceable assets. Custom wood crates with tailored padding, insulation, and finishing protect against shock, humidity, temperature changes, and handling damage.

Trade Show & Exhibit Materials

Booths, displays, and event signage often have awkward shapes and demand fast installation. Our custom crates are tailored for easy loading, safe transport, and organized storage between events.

Manufacturing & OEM Components

Parts with exacting tolerances require custom protection that preserves integrity during shipping, storage, and assembly processes.

No matter the type of item, our team builds crates that match your cargo’s size, shape, sensitivity, and transportation environment.

Precision Design & Engineering

What sets our custom shipping crates apart is professional engineering and craftsmanship. We don’t guess at dimensions—we measure, plan, and build based on real specifications.

Our process includes:

📏 Precision measurement to ensure a snug, secure fit
🧰 Material selection based on weight, exposure, and handling conditions
🪚 Structural design optimized for strength and performance
📦 Internal bracing, padding, and blocking for stability
📄 Labeling and documentation for efficient logistics

This meticulous approach results in crates that protect—no matter how long the journey or how rough the handling.

Superior Materials for Maximum Performance

The quality of the crate depends on the materials used. At Crates of Las Vegas, we only build with:

Premium structural lumber

Heavy‑duty fasteners and brackets

Moisture barriers and vapor protection

Shock‑absorbing internal pads and braces

Optional moisture‑resistant finishes

These materials deliver long‑lasting durability and reliable performance during local, national, and international shipments.

Designed for Transportation & Handling Ease

Custom shipping crates aren’t just strong—they’re smart. Our crates are designed for efficient handling by logistics partners, including:

✔ Forklift access
✔ Pallet‑ready bases

Efficient handling reduces transit time, minimizes labor costs, and improves safety at every stage of shipping.
