Why Custom Crating Matters in Aliante

Traditional packaging such as cardboard boxes or standard containers may work for everyday items, but they fall short when it comes to high‑value, fragile, or irregularly shaped goods. These items require custom engineered protection designed for durability and performance under real‑world shipping conditions.

Custom crating protects your cargo by:

✔ Providing tailored fit and stability
✔ Minimizing shock, vibration, and impact
✔ Reducing risk of damage or loss
✔ Supporting safe handling and transport
✔ Ensuring compliance with carrier and freight protocols

Whether you’re shipping locally, across the state, or internationally, proper packaging makes all the difference between a successful delivery and costly damage.

What Sets Our Crating Services Premier

At Crates of Las Vegas, our commitment to quality goes beyond building crates — we deliver engineered solutions backed by expertise, precision, and professional service. Here’s what makes our Aliante custom crating services stand out:

1. Custom Crate Design Tailored to Your Needs

Not all shipments are the same — and neither are our crates. We begin every project with a detailed evaluation of your cargo’s:

📏 Exact measurements
⚖ Weight and balance factors
📦 Fragility and sensitivity
🚚 Transportation and handling conditions

With this data, we design crates that provide the best possible protection for your item, ensuring a snug fit that minimizes movement and damage.

2. Premium Materials & Skilled Construction

Each custom crate is constructed using high‑grade structural materials chosen for strength, durability, and long‑lasting performance:

✔ Reinforced lumber framing
✔ Secure hardware and fasteners
✔ Moisture‑resistant barriers (when required)
✔ Interior bracing and cushioning systems

Our experienced craftsmen build every crate with meticulous attention to detail, resulting in packaging that delivers reliable protection even under heavy handling and long transit conditions.

3. Custom Solutions for Diverse Cargo Types

Aliante boasts a wide range of local businesses and residential needs — and we provide custom crate solutions for various industries:

Heavy & Industrial Equipment
